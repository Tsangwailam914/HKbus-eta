## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Framework: Nuxt, Vue.js, pinia, i18n, TypeScript, JavaScript

## Optimizations

Would love to add a filter to filter out the nearest stops for users, and a map to show the location of the bus stop.

## Lessons Learned:

Adding state managemnet to the app can help to optimize the performance because it allows you to have a share state appear in components where they are used.
